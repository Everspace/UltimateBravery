# UltimateBravery
A React based static website driven by Riot API and static data, so that it (hopefully) remains more up to date.

# Requirements:

* Node `v6.9.1`
* Ruby `>=2.3.0` with dev tools available.
* A web browser
* Bravery

#How to run:

# Start the dev server

    rake dev:start

Navigate your browser to `localhost:9001/static/index.html`
    
#Deployment

##1. Build the things

    rake clobber
    rake dd:download:everything
    rake node:build
    
##2. Combine assets
Copy the contents of `./node/build` and `./node/static` into `./build`

##3. Deploy
Put the contents of `./build` on your favourite dumb fileserver. I'm using an S3 bucket to host http://bravery.lol/
