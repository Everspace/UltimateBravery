# UltimateBravery
A React based static website driven by Riot API and static data, so that it (hopefully) remains more up to date, and people can bravely go where few have gone before in League of Legends

Things are currently highly experimental and probably very broken until a `0.2` release.

# Requirements:

* Node `v6.9.1`
* Ruby `>=2.3.0`
* A web browser
* Bravery

#How to run:

##Init

    git clone <this repo>
    cd UltimateBravery
    bundle install

## Start the dev server

    rake dev:start

Navigate your browser to `localhost:9001/static/index.html` (or let it pop open automatically)
    
##Deployment

###1. Build the things

    rake clean
    rake dd:download:all
    rake node:build
    
###2. Combine assets
Copy the contents of `./node/build` and `./node/static` into `./build`

###3. Deploy
Put the contents of `./build` on your favourite dumb fileserver. I'm using an S3 bucket to host http://bravery.lol/
